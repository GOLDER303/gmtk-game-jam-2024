# Fortress of Scales

Fortress of Scales is a game created for the GMTK Game Jam 2024. In this game, you are a wizard exiled from the kingdom, hunted by warriors of the crusade. And the only thing that can defend you are machines created from dragon scales. The theme for this jam was "Build to Scale" and we tried to reflect that by using both the literal use of scales and the idea of growing and scaling infrastructure to fight enemies.
